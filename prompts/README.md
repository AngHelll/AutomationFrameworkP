# AI Context Directory

**Complete technical reference for AI agents to understand and work with this automation framework.**

---

## Purpose

This directory contains comprehensive framework documentation formatted specifically for AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to:

- Understand framework architecture
- Generate code following framework patterns
- Debug issues
- Add new features
- Answer technical questions

## How AI Should Use This Context

### Step 1: Load Relevant Context
When user asks about the framework, load appropriate files:
- General questions → `FRAMEWORK.md`
- Architecture questions → `architecture.md`
- BDD questions → `bdd_with_behave.md`
- Errors/issues → `troubleshooting.md`
- Code quality → `best_practices.md`

### Step 2: Apply Framework Patterns
Use loaded context to:
- Generate code matching framework style
- Follow established patterns
- Use correct imports and structure
- Apply best practices

### Step 3: Provide Directive Responses
Responses should be:
- **Authoritative:** "The framework uses X" (not "you could use X")
- **Specific:** Exact file paths, class names, commands
- **Complete:** Working code examples
- **Directive:** Clear instructions, not suggestions

---

## Documentation Tone

All files in `prompts/context/` use **directive, authoritative language**:

✅ **DO:**
- "The framework uses Behave for BDD"
- "Place page objects in `pages/` directory"
- "Execute tests with `pytest` command"
- "The BasePage class provides retry logic"

❌ **DON'T:**
- "We recently added BDD support"
- "You can write tests"
- "This might help"
- "Consider using page objects"

---

## Maintenance

### When Adding Features
1. Update `FRAMEWORK.md` with feature usage
2. Update `architecture.md` if pattern changes
3. Update `best_practices.md` with new conventions
4. Add examples to `few_shot_examples.json`

### When Fixing Issues
1. Document solution in `troubleshooting.md`
2. Update `best_practices.md` to prevent recurrence
3. Update `FRAMEWORK.md` if configuration changes

---

## Integration with IDE AI Tools

### GitHub Copilot
Load context files as reference to improve suggestions

### ChatGPT/Claude
Copy relevant context files into chat for framework-aware responses

### Cursor AI
Place cursor in relevant files for context-aware completions
